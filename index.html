<h1> Felons, Fingerprints and Failures </h1>
<h2> How you can be arrested, charged and sentenced and still have no criminal record in Pennsylvania </h2>
<hr>
<p class="byline"> By Joseph Jaafari, images by Daouna Jeong </p>

<p class="explainer">As fingerprint scanning technology is adopted in departments nationwide -- and in even the most rural of towns -- fingerprints submitted to state and federal background check systems become the single-most important factor in determining a person's identity and criminal history. In Pennsylvania, there have been more than 25,000 people not fingerprinted for their criminal charges in 2015, according to state data. Officials chalk it up to police training and a lack of knowledge, but the end result is thousands of people who could have access to a weapon legally or work in areas where they shouldn't. <p>

<p class="h3"> There were <span style="color:red">25,000</span> people not fingerprinted for crimes in 2015.<p></p>
<p class="h3"> How many of those were in your county?<p>
<div id="calculator">
