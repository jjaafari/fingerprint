<h3>Summary </h3>
<p>Between the beginning of 2013 and March this year, more than 97,000 people have not been fingerprinted for crimes, including 22,000 felony charges, according to data gathered through the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency. Last year, 6,000 people who were charged with felony crimes across the state werenâ€™t fingerprinted. Within Philadelphia and its surrounding counties, 3,260 people were not fingerprinted for criminal charges. A quarter of those were for felonies. </p>

<h3> Data used </h3>
Data was collected through the Pennsylvania Commission on crime and Delinquency. For the past 3 years, the PCCD has been transparent in putting up quarterly results of audits done on the State Police and individual police departments throughout the state in regards to figerprinting. The data can be viewed on their website below:

Other data used were provided through the PCCD by submitting Right to Know requests. 

<h3>How we got the data </h3>
The problem with the dashboard the PCCD provides is that its not queryable immediately, and needs to be downlaoded individually by county, by quarter for each county and also by quarter for the state as a whole. This allows cross referencing to make sure all the data adds up and is accurate. Data tables were exported into CSV friles and then cleaned up using Open Refine. The data was later put up into CartoDB to be queried using SQL.
